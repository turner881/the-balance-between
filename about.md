I am a Buckeye born and bred, graduating from The Ohio State University in 2013. In September that year I made the leap to expat life by moving to Dubai with my boyfriend, Matt. My life revolves around practicing yoga daily, traveling as much as possible, watching too much Netflix, exploring Dubailand, and looking for new creative outlets. Driven by a passion for learning and culture from a very young age, I find inspiration in everything - beautiful photos, delicious meals, breathtaking views, the fascinating people around me, the list goes on.

The purpose of this blog is to document my journey to finding balance in my life - staying grounded, but having the courage to go on adventures and seek a higher existence. This philosophy is made up of daily yoga practice, mindful thinking, seeking out inspiration, experiencing new things, and loving deeply.

For me, this journey is symbolized by the triangle, which is the strongest geometric shape, but only if all three sides are in balance. Based on a mantra that I learned at YMCA summer camp (both as a camper and a counselor), the three sides of the triangle represent spirit, mind, and body. To reach your full potential all three aspects of your life must be equal. For more on this topic, check out Yoga Journey.
