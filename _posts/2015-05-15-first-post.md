Ahh the dreaded first post...

Welcome to my new blog, friends! I've had this post sitting in my drafts for two weeks because I've been trying to find the right words to introduce The Balance Between and convince you to become a reader (no pressure!) To put it simply, I am a twenty-three year old girl who loves to write, create, and explore. I do not have life all figured out, and I wanted an outlet to make sense of it all. I hope you will find my musings entertaining, at times enlightening, and maybe even inspiring.

To keep this short and sweet, here are the basics...

Who: Hannah Casey, an Ohio native with serious wanderlust on a never ending search for inspiration and adventure (see About )

What: The Balance Between is a creative destination for inspiration - yoga, travel, art, adventure, love, beauty, and health (see About )

Where: Currently based in Dubai.

When: Now of course.

Why: I am driven by a passion for learning and knowledge, and I wanted to create a space where I can explore my wide range of interests, record my recent endeavor into the world of yoga, and connect with like-minded people. It also is a way to stay in touch with my family and friends back home, all while painting a realistic picture of expat life.

I hope you will enjoy reading The Balance Between!
