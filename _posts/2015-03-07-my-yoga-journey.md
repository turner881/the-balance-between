My yoga journey began in September 2014. For the year and a half leading up to that point I had been on a strict strength training regimen, 4 to 5 days a week lifting in the gym. I went home to Ohio for 3 weeks and came back with no motivation to start weight training again. Exercise is my outlet - I don't work out just to look good, I work out because it makes me feel great. It helps me with anxiety and is my natural anti-depressant. The bottom line is that I love being active. It makes me feel like myself, happy and healthy, so it's important to me that I enjoy what I'm doing. While feeling really uninspired by training, I sort of stumbled upon yoga.

After a few classes, I felt brand new. I had found the source of inspiration that my old training regime wasn't providing. In just a few short months I have accomplished more in my practice and achieved asanas I never thought myself capable of.

For the last few years I have lived by the philosophy that in order to reach enlightenment and happiness, you must keep three parts of yourself in balance: spirit, mind, and body. This is represented by the triangle that I have had tattooed on the inside of my left ankle since the summer of 2012. To best explain how this yoga journey has improved by life, I'll break it down...

SPIRIT...

I grew up Catholic, but struggled with rationalizing religion with my beliefs from a young age. Catholic schools in Ohio were not the most liberal of places in the early 2000s, and coming from a very liberal family (by conservative suburbia standards), I couldn't justify the doctrines of the church that seemed to me to be hypocritical and in complete odds with God's teachings. To be perfectly honest with you, I don't think I've ever been religious. It's not that I don't have faith in a higher power - I've just never been sure what or who that power is.Whether it is in my solo practice, the quotes I love, or the music I listen to, I feel spiritually elevated. Yoga is often referred to as a "practical philosophy" because it requires no adherence to a belief system. Yoga is about connecting the mind with the body in order to achieve inner (and outer) peace.

MIND...

I have struggled with anxiety disorder for a long time, and exercise is one of the ways I keep it from affecting my life. When I found yoga, I was struggling with keeping the anxiety at bay. The first yoga book I read starts off with this: "Balance and harmony are the essence of yoga." Daily practice, especially solo sessions, helped me return to practicing mindfulness. I am able to treat my anxiety without presciption drugs, which I am very fortunate for. That doesn't mean I don't need medication. My medication comes in training my mind not to automatically jump to extremes and negatives in stressful situations. I have to think through an issue clearly and be honest with myself. Yoga helps me clear my mind so that I can see through my anxiety to the root of the issue and resolve it. A great description of mindfulness is this:
Mindfulness is the direct, immediate, and vivid experience of whatever is arising here and now. It is a nonjudgmental awareness that does not get caught up in thoughts or concepts or "stories" of any kind. - Stephen Cope

BODY...

Us annoying yogis are not exaggerating about the physical benefits of practice. When I was lifting weights I gained a lot of muscle, but it was not lean muscle. I was strong but I wasn't very comfortable with my new physique. I am not a bodybuilder. I never will be. I started losing weight right away. Now, after 5 months of regular practice, my muscles are leaner, my body is slimmer and lighter, and my arms, waist, and legs are more defined than ever. Never again will I rely on countless sets of crunches to "get abs." Yoga requires so much core strength, my abs have never felt stronger or tighter. I totally get why Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson swear by yoga. Yoga will give you a killer body if you dedicate yourself! Yoga has boosted my metabolism (and confidence), and given me so much energy. Anyone who says yoga isn't athletic doesn't know what their talking about!
